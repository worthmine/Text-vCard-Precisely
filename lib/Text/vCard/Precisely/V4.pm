=head1 NAME

Text::vCard::Precisely::V4 - Read, Write and Edit B<vCards 4.0>

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
You can unlock types that will be available in vCard4.0

 use Text::vCard::Precisely;
 my $vc = Text::vCard::Precisely->new( version => '4.0' );
 # Or you can write like below:
 my $vc4 = Text::vCard::Precisely::V4->new();

The Usage is same with L<Text::vCard::Precisely::V3>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an additional version for reading/writing for vCard4.0. it's just a wrapper of L<Text::vCard::Precisely::V3|https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::vCard::Precisely::V3>

B<Caution!> It's NOT be recommended because some reasons below:

=over

=item

Mac OS X and iOS can't parse vCard4.0 with UTF-8 precisely.

=item

Android 4.4.x can't parse vCard4.0.

=back

Note that the vCard RFC requires C<FN> type.
And this module does not check or warn if these conditions have not been met.

=head1 Constructors

=head2 load_hashref($HashRef)

SAME as 3.0

=head2 loadI<file($file>name)

SAME as 3.0

=head2 load_string($vCard)

SAME as 3.0

=cut

override '_parse_param' => sub {
    my ( $self, $content ) = @_;

    return $ref;
};

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_string()

Returns the vCard as a string with non-decoded UTF-8.
if you have `use utf8;` in your scope, you have to do C<Encode::decode_utf8>

=cut

    $str .= 'ANNIVERSARY:' . $self->anniversary() . $cr if $self->anniversary();
    $str .= 'GENDER:' . $self->gender() . $cr           if $self->gender();
    $str .= 'UID:' . $self->uid() . $cr                 if $self->uid();

    map { $str .= "CLIENTPIDMAP:$_" . $cr } @{ $self->clientpidmap() } if $self->clientpidmap();

    $str .= $self->_footer();
    return $self->_fold($str);
}

=head2 as_file($filename)

Write data in vCard format to $filename.

Dies if not successful.

=head1 SIMPLE GETTERS/SETTERS

These methods accept and return strings.

=head2 version()

Returns Version number of the vcard. Defaults to B<'3.0'>

It is B<READONLY> method. So you can NOT downgrade it to 3.0

=head2 rev()

To specify revision information about the current vCard

The format in as_string() is B<different from 3.0>, but the interface is SAME

=head1 COMPLEX GETTERS/SETTERS

They are based on Moose with coercion

So these methods accept not only ArrayRef[HashRef] but also ArrayRef[Str],
single HashRef or single Str

Read source if you were confused

=head2 n()

The format is SAME as 3.0

If you want to send precisely the vCard with UTF-8 characters to
the B<ALMOST> of smartphones, Use 3.0

It seems to be TOO EARLY to use 4.0

This module uses C<\P{ascii}> in regexp so You have to use 5.12.5 and later
